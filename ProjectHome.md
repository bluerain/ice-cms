Tired of helping your clients with complex content management systems?

Say hello to Icy CMS. It aims to be an easy to use CMS written in PHP for small websites, perfect for your clients. Using HTML5 standards, the client easily manages content on his/her website, in your design! The client can see his/her changes immediately.
Icy cms takes a _cool_ approach to development too - it will be extremely easy to implement. And did I mention it's lightweight?

Icy is currently under development.
Stay cool!
